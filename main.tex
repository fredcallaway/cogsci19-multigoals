\title{Limitations on goal representation in hierarchical planning}
 
\author{Anon Y. Mous}


\begin{document}

\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
When faced with a large and complex problem, people naturally break it up into several smaller and simpler problems. This hierarchical decomposition of an ultimate goal into sub-goals facilitates planning by reducing the number of factors that must be considered at one time. However, it can also lead to suboptimal decision making, leading one to miss opportunities to make progress towards multiple subgoals with a single action. This potential for suboptimality can be ameliorated by considering multiple subgoals at once, but at the cost of increasing the number of factors that must be considered and thus increasing the computational burden of planning. Here, we present a model of planning with compositional goal representations and show that it explains the errors people make in a Towers of London task better than a limited-depth search model. Our results suggest that people are capable of representing and pursuing multiple subgoals at once, but that the number of subgoals is generally quite limited. Furthermore, we find that the degree of representational limitation may be an important latent dimension for explaining individual differences in planning ability. Finally, we (hopefully!) find that the inferred representational limitations are sensitive to the cost of suboptimal planning, indicating that people may rationally choose a goal representation that trades off between representational costs and decision quality.

Compositional goals/options.

Overview of present work.


\section{Model}
We model participant decisions as emerging from a two step hierarchical planning procedure. 

- Limited depth model

- Limited goal representation model



\section{Experiment}

\subsection{Methods}
\subsubsection{Stimuli and procedure}

In each trial, participants are presented with two configurations of stacked blocks marked with letters of the alphabet and asked to rearrange the blocks in one stack to match the blocks in the other or goal stack (Fig. XX). Only the top block of a stack can be moved, and the board is limited to contain at most 3 spaces for stacks. In all trials, the goal stack contains the same blocks arranged in alphabetical order in the middle space. Participants were asked to complete 3 tutorial trials of increasing difficulty (a 3-block trial, a 4-block trial, and a 5-block trial) and then complete 16 6-block trials which were analyzed below.
% Following the completion of the trials, participants completed a short survey to assess XXX (do we mention this?).
% Fred: No, it's to solicit feedback on the experiment, not actually part of the study.

\subsubsection{Participants}
We recruited 41 participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Each participant received \$2 for completing the task, which took an average of 8.9 minutes.

\subsection{Results}
